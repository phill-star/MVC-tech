This application was designed to keep track blog post. 

When I navigate to main page, I am presented with a dashboard containing blogs 

I have the option to login if I have existing accounts or create a new one. 

When Iâ€™m logged in, I have the option to post new blogs. 

When I view existing blog post, I have the option to edit or delete it. 

When I am done, I can logout & them system should bring me back to the dashboard. 

If I am idle for awhile, the system should sign me out do to session expiring.
